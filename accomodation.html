                    Come to Delhi and enjoy your sojourn at Vajra 2015 without worrying about accomodation, we offer a host of various                               amenities including clean and hygienic rooms, a nutritious and well-balanced diet from the hostel mess and various
                    other facilities needed by attendee sportsmen/women including a badminton court, grounds for practice, and plenty
                    of campus space. Accomodation is available at this point of time, and will be allotted on a first-come first-serve
                    basis. If accomodation is freed up at the last minute, the space created will be given based on factors such as
                    immediate need and date of registration. The decision to give accomodation solely rests with the authorities, and
                    the decision taken by the reqisite authorities will be final and binding. Participants are expected to stay on 
                    their best behaviour for the duration of the fest and comply to general hostel guidelines.<br /><br />
                    <b>Please do not forget to tick the box in the registration form indicating that you'll be needing accomodation,
                    we might not be able to help you at the last moment if you fail to do so!</b><br /><br/></p>

                    Getting there was never easier. SRM's campus can be reached via NH-8, and is located on the Delhi-Meerut
                    highway. It can be easily reached via public transportation if you use the metro network
                    to reach <strong>Vaishali</strong> metro station, from where the city buses ("UP Roadways")
                    ply very often. SRM will also run it's own buses along that route for the duration of the
                    event to make it easier for participants to get to the campus and back. Our buses
                    are air-conditioned to help you beat the heat and ride in comfort. Public buses also ply from the ISBT at
                    Kashmere Gate, so you can reach the venue if that is more suitable. Click <a href="BusRoutes.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> for more
                    details regarding public bus networks to SRM. Additionally, you can view the <a href="http://www.delhimetrorail.com/Zoom_Map.aspx" target="_blank">metro route map</a> for
                    an overview of how to get to Vaishali. Here's a map to help you:<br /><br />
